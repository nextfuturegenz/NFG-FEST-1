Hangman
- Building a Hangman game is one of the best JavaScript project ideas for beginners who want a bit of a challenge.
If you’re not familiar, the hangman game is about guessing a random word by guessing letters one by one. If the player runs out of guesses, the game is over.
Although the gameplay may sound simple, you need to consider a few critical elements in your JavaScript code:
Set a maximum limit for guesses.
Display the remaining number of guesses to the player.
Provide the player with an interface to input their guesses.
This beginner JavaScript project will probably take you a bit longer, but it’s great practice. You will need to think about random choice, variables, boolean values, inputs and outputs, strings, lengths, and more.
